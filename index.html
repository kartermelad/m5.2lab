        <h2>The Trouble with Bears</h2>
      
        <p><strong>By Evan Wild</strong></p>
        
        <p>
          Tall, lumbering, angry, and dangerous — real live bears are proud, independent creatures, 
          always on the hunt for food. They’re nothing like the bears you see in fictional portrayals, 
          such as Baloo from The Jungle Book.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision? 
          In this article, we’ll try to answer those questions and give you real insight into the life of a bear.
        </p>
      
        <h3>Types of Bear</h3>
        <p>
          Bears generally come in two varieties — large and medium. Small bears don’t truly exist; 
          if you see a smaller bear, it’s more than likely a bear cub of a larger species. 
          Bears can also be classified by habitat: both large and medium bears can thrive in urban or countryside environments.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The following table provides some useful facts about wild and urban bears:
        </p>
      
        <table>
          <caption>Comparison of Wild and Urban Bears</caption>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th scope="col">Bear Type</th>
              <th scope="col">Coat</th>
              <th scope="col">Adult size</th>

            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">Wild</th>
              <td>Brown or black</td>

              <td>25 to 28 years</td>
              <td>Fish, meat, plants</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">Urban</th>
              <td>North Face</td>
              <td>18 to 22</td>
              <td>Condos and coffee shops</td>
              <td>20 to 32 years</td>
              <td>Starbucks, sushi</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      
        <h3>Habitats and Eating Habits</h3>
        <p>
          Wild bears eat a varied diet of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other naturally growing ingredients.
          They typically hunt for food in woodlands and rivers, but may seek sustenance from farms or country houses.
          They often live in caves, tents, or cottages away from crowded populations.

        <p>
          Urban (gentrified) bears have largely adopted different living patterns, frequenting dumpsters, bins, 
          or fast-food restaurants. They’re known to sleep in bus shelters, parks, or even their own apartments. 
          They may occasionally hunt urban wildlife, but typically scavenge from readily available sources.

        <h3>Mating Rituals</h3>
        <p>
          Bears are romantic creatures by nature, generally seeking a lifelong mate. They decorate their dwellings 
          to impress potential partners: wild bears may use cave paintings or beds of reeds, while urban bears 
          opt for mood lighting and a classic Michael Bublé soundtrack.

                <p>Oh I am so glad you taught me all about the big brown angry guys in the woods. With their sniffing little noses and their bad attitudes, they can sure be a menace — I was thinking of putting them all in a truck and driving them outta here. I run a zoo, you know.</p>
